# Mozilla Apps Enhancements
 
 add-on that provides  accessibility features for Mozilla applications
 
## Firefox

* NVDA+A (desktop) or NVDA+Control+A (laptop) Reads the page address. If pressed twice quickly, copies it to clipboard.
* NVDA+End (desktop) or NVDA+Shift+End (laptop) Reads the status bar. If pressed twice quickly, copies it to clipboard.
* NVDA+F8 Shows a list of opened tabs. If pressed twice quickly, shows buttons of tool bar.
* Also, you can assign, in NVDA preferences, an alternative gesture to display the toolbar buttons which is more comfortable for you than twice pressing.
* NVDA+Control+N Reads the last notification and it takes the system focus to it if it is possible. By pressing two times quickly shows the history of notifications.
* NVDA+F6 Brings the focus to the document.
 
## Thunderbird
 
* In a message window:
	* Control+Shift+(1-4) Reads the sender and recipients of the message. If pressed twice quickly, opens the options menu.
	* Alt+Control+Shift+1-4 opens the options menu too; Use it if twice pressing does not work well.
	* Control+Shift+5 Reads the subject of the message.
	* Control+Shift+6 Reads date of the message.
	* Control+Shift+A Brings the focus to the list of attachments, if any.
(These scripts are also available in the list of messages if you activate the preview pane.)
* In the bar of fast filtering:
	* Press down Arrow to display more options, enter to check/unchek the selected option.
* In messages list:
	* If the preview pane is active, press NVDA+downArrow (desktop) or NVDA+A (laptop) to read the message without leaving the list.
	* Control+NVDA+1-9 moves between columns.
	* NVDA+H Displays a dialog in which you can change the order of the columns in the message list.

Keystrokes can be customized in  Preferences  of NVDA > Input gestures when Firefox or Thunderbird are open.
