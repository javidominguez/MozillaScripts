# Mozilla Apps Enhancements 
 
 add-on that provides  accessibility features for Mozilla applications 
 
## Firefox 

* NVDA+A (desktop) or NVDA+Control+A (laptop) Reads the page address. If pressed twice quickly, copies it to clipboard. 
* NVDA+End (desktop) or NVDA+Shift+End (laptop) Reads the status bar. If pressed twice quickly, copies it to clipboard. 
* NVDA+F8 Shows a list of opened tabs. If pressed twice quickly, shows buttons of tool bar. 
* Also, you can assign, in NVDA preferences, an alternative gesture to display the toolbar buttons which is more comfortable for you than twice pressing. 
* NVDA+Control+N Reads the last notification and it takes the system focus to it if it is possible. By pressing two times quickly shows the history of notifications. 
* NVDA+F6 Brings the focus to the document. 
 
## Thunderbird 
 
* In a message window: 
	* Control+Shift+(1-9) Reads the sender and recipients of the message. If pressed twice quickly, opens the options menu. 
	* Alt+Control+Shift+1-9 opens the options menu too; Use it if twice pressing does not work well. 
	* Control+Shift+0 Reads the subject of the message. 
	* Control+Shift+' Reads date of the message (only in versions prior to Thunderbird 102.0). 
	* Control+Shift+A Brings the focus to the list of attachments, if any. 
(These scripts are also available in the list of messages if you activate the preview pane.) 
* In the bar of fast filtering: 
	* Press down Arrow to display more options, enter to check/unchek the selected option. 
* In messages list: 
	* If the preview pane is active, press NVDA+downArrow (desktop) or NVDA+A (laptop) to read the message without leaving the list. 
		* Control+NVDA+1-9 moves between columns. 
	* NVDA+H Displays a dialog in which you can change the order of the columns in the message list. 

Keystrokes can be customized in  Preferences  of NVDA > Input gestures when Firefox or Thunderbird are open. 
 
In NVDA Preferences > Options > Mozilla Thunderbird you can enable/disable automatic message reading in the preview pane.
