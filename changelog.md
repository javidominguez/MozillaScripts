* Fixed what was broken with the Thunderbird 102.0 update 
* Again correctly reads message headers. 
* Gestures for reading headers have been modified; now control+shift+1-9 reads the sender and recipients and control+shift+0 reads the subject. 
* Now correctly reads the status bar. 
* Message reading in the preview pane has been improved and automatic reading has been implemented. Now when selecting a message in the list its content will be read without having to press anything else (as long as the preview panel is activated [F8]). This feature can be turned on or off in NVDA Preferences > Options > Mozilla Thunderbird or by using a gesture (not assigned by default). 
* Some performance improvements and minor bug fixes.
