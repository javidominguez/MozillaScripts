Fixed a bug in Thunderbird app module by which the Addon stopped recognizing when the focus is on the messages list which caused some features of to stop working.
In some update of Thunderbird the value of the XML-Roles attribute was changed from Treegrid to Tree. The Beta channel versions maintains the old value. Other attributes, such as tree:true, have been used to depend less on these changes.
